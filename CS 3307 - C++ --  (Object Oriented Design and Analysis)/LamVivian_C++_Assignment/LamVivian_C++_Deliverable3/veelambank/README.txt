To the TA marking this:

Hi,

Originally I wasn't going to hand anything in for this assignment until my peers prompted and encourage me to do so. I've been undergoing personal health issues, but I understand that it should not be of your concern, nor do I want to use it as an excuse for anything. I am not sure if it was appropriate getting medical accommodation, but I think I would rather just hand in everything that I have (I didn't get to test everything, my code is spaghetti). I managed to get most of the core features functional, but I didn't really comment or add any additional features. Although you aren't inclined to, please don't mark as harshly. I am not asking to completely change your marking standards, I am just asking you to please not be super picky (usually I comment a lot and my documentation is thorough, but it's pretty sparse this time). Even the slightest generosity is appreciated :)

Thanks,
Vivian

to compile:
g++ -Wall main.cpp -o main

or if you just want to run the executable
In the Debug folder open the “vleeambank.exe” to run the executable.


main.cpp is the main source

ENSURE THE FOLLOWING ARE IN THE DIRECTORY BEFORE COMPILING:
Manager.h
Manager.cpp
Customer.h
Customer.cpp
Maitenance.h
Maitenance.cpp

(yes I know I spelled maitenance incorrectly in some places)
